## Description

- The goal with this project was to take a started .js document, add variables, functions, and methods to create a randomly generated password. This seemed like an easy task at a first glance, although, during its creation I found out it wasn't so easy and it took some real thinking! This was good practice and a great tool for the future to reflect on in future projects!
- This project was partially created for me, I just needed to make the generator itself and set parameters for what the user wanted within the password... The only tools available were past lectures and resources and (extensive) help from the Teacher, TA's, and also classmates were a huge help!
- The reason for making this project was to challenge what I can create within javascript, it will be a helpful tool for me as well as anyone else that stumbles uppon the page!
- I learned that functions and methods are a key ingredient to success in javascript I also learned that the big picture should be the main focus when you write your code... when you get tunnel vision you have to go back and diagnose what you missed later on... either way, I really enjoyed the challenge of this project!
